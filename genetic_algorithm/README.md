Genetic Algorithm, or GA, is a well-known evolutionary-based heuristic search algorithm used in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and computing. 
GA is inspired by the notion of survival of the ﬁttest, a theory driven from biological evolution.
GA makes use of a population which is composed of individuals, also called chromosome, to solve both constrained and unconstrained optimization problem. 
Each chromosome is composed of genes, the smallest unit containing a genetic value.
GA is an iterative algorithm and, at every step, it employs generic operators involving selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve new, hopefully better, 
individuals that represent the solution toward the problem at hand. 
The quality of each evolved chromosome is evaluated through a given ﬁtness function. 
At the end of the evolutionary process, it returns the best solution found for the problem
